Today I made the decision to regain control of my product. I fixed the problems with eestec.net master and reclaimed my project.
I am not afraid of the software that I created. I will fix those bugs.

On a more serious note, I think the decision to rewrite everything in eestec.net was questionable. It told me a lot
about AngularJS, django-rest-framework and client-server communication but it slowed down work significantly.
I'm not dropping the version 3.0 release, but I will put more effort into maintaining the 2.0 version.
