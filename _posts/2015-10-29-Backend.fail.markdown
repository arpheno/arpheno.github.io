I have started a new application which can be found at (https://backend.fail).

It is a platform as a service, which let's users edit code examples of popular web frameworks
like django or ruby on rails with an online interface. It takes care about installing the
framework and databases for you and hosts your code to display the result of your code.

I think this project has great potential, and I'm looking for help with it.

You can find possibilities to contribute at (https://github.com/arpheno/backendfail/)
